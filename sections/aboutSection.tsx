                    Hi! ðŸ‘‹ <b>Iâ€™m Muâ€™adhim</b>, a passionate Software Engineer with {ExperienceAutoCount()} years of professional experience building modern web applications.
                    I specialize in creating clean, scalable, and responsive user interfaces using React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS,
                    while also working with backend technologies like Node.js and Supabase.
                    <br />
                    I started my professional journey in 2023 at Refactory, where I contributed to enterprise-level projects,
                    collaborating closely with teams and delivering solutions for both frontend and backend systems.
                    Later, at Ganesha Operation, I was entrusted to lead web security initiatives while continuing to develop real-time and API-integrated applications.
                    Currently, Iâ€™m working on a remote startup project called Harmooni, where Iâ€™m helping to shape its core architecture and UI.
                    <br />
                    Beyond my professional work, I enjoy learning new technologies and exploring how to solve complex problems efficiently.
                    Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in Python and Golang, with several personal projects available on GitHub.
                    <br />
                    I thrive in collaborative environments and am highly motivated to contribute to impactful projects â€” especially in remote or distributed teams.
